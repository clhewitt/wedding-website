<h2>Travel</h2>
We’re believers that all the best places are a little off the beaten path, and Stanley is no exception. It’s going to take a little effort to get there, but we can’t wait to share this special place with you. Thank you for making the trek to join us!
Boise Airport
There will likely be more flight options into Boise than Sun Valley, but the drive is longer. Budget three hours for this beautiful drive along the Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway. The roads are well-maintained but winding. Stop in at Kirkham Hot Springs just off the road when you’re two hours into the drive and ready to officially enter vacation mode. Directions (includes the Hot Springs).
Sun Valley (Friedman Memorial Airport)
Plan for the drive to take a little over an hour. You’ll take Highway 75 through the Sawtooth National Forest and along stunning views of the Sawtooth Mountains. Look out for pronghorn antelope, mountain goats and sandhill cranes.

From either airport, we recommend avoiding driving at night. There is beautiful scenery you won’t want to miss, and the combination of windy dark roads and wildlife can be dangerous. If you land in Sun Valley or Boise Friday evening, you might want to spend the night there and drive in the morning.

<h2> Where to stay </h2>
Book early! Stanley is a very popular summer destination, and we expect that to be especially the case for Labor Day Weekend in 2021. There are already a couple places that are full, so book fast if you don’t want to wind up in a tent!

<h3>Stanley Cabins</h3>
Embrace the outdoorsy experience, and stay in a cozy cabin.

<h3><a href="https://triangleccabins.com/">Triangle C Cabins</a></h3>

These standalone cabins are cozy, a little rustic and very popular. Enjoy the
firepit in the evenings and volleyball, bocce and other games on-site. Expect
this site to be packed with other wedding guests. As part of Redfish Resort,
free shuttles to stunning Redfish Lake are a perk of staying here.

<h3>Stanley Hotels</h3>
Stanley has a few hotels scattered throughout this tiny town. Here are the few we recommend most.

<h3><a href="https://www.stanleytownsquare.com/">Stanley Town Square Condo Hotel</a></h3>
These are probably the nicest accommodations in town. Most are suites with multiple rooms that have been updated with kitchens and upscale but homey decor. If you're a family or friends wanting to share and aren’t interested in roughing it, book here!

<h3><a href="https://redfishriversideinn.com/">Redfish Riverside Inn</a></h3>

Outside Stanley

<h3><a href="https://idahorocky.com/">Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch</a></h3>
If you're looking for a really special experience, look no further. This is a luxury guest ranch with great food on site (it's all inclusive). This is the furthest away of the options we recommend, but still only a 15-minute drive from Stanley and the wedding venue.

<h3><a href="https://redfishlake.com/">Redfish Lake Lodge</a></h3>
Set next to crystal clear Redfish Lake and with stunning Sawtooth Mountain views, this resort is the most popular spot in the area. If you can find a room, snag it. It’s about a 10-minute drive from Stanley and the wedding venue. Whether or not you stay here, we recommend visiting Redfish Lake during your stay.
